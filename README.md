## D&D Beyond Dice and Discord Bot Integration

A Chrome Extension that listens for dice rolls on D&D Beyond Character Sheets (e.g. [Remigius](https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/kamnikite/characters/23934295)) and posts the results into a Discord server via a bot.

The problem with current dice rolling bots like [Avrae](https://avrae.io/) is that they lack the thrill of physical dice. The problem with physical dice is that they lack the transparency of dice rolling bots because if you are playing a distributed game, no one else can see your dice roll. By using D&D Beyond's virtual dice and posting the result into a Discord server, the player gets the thrill of life-like virtual dice with the transparency of dice rolling bots.
